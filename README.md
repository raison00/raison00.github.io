# Style Guide

Style Guide is a boilerplate for creating a custom style guide

## How it works
Style Guide is built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), a static site generator which works quite well for managing the content of a style guide.

The tool can consume and display components from anywhere, but in my own workflow we import patterns from [Pattern Lab](http://patternlab.io/) into Style Guide for display. 

## Getting Started
1. In the command line, navigate to the root of the project and run the `jekyll serve` command. This will build the static site and watch for changes.
2. Visit `http://127.0.0.1:4000/` in your browser to see the style guide.

customize the style guide for your needs and populate it with your content and components.
